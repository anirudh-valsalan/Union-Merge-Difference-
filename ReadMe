The class contain method for finding intersection,union and difference of two list which contain elements(non-duplicate) in sorted order.


-- Test main method which will instruct user to input
	1)The length of firstList.
	2)The elements of first list.
	3)The lenghth of secondList.
	4)The elements of second list.

	Assume that all the input will be in the form of Integers and elements are inserted in sorted order with no duplicate elements.

	
-- Intersect method :Method to perform the intersection.
    
   parameters  :list1 -  The first list.
               :list2 -  The second list.
			   :outlist - The output List,which will contain non-duplicate elements which are common to list1 and list2 in sorted order.
   All list extends set interface so duplicate elements will not be present.

-- Union Method  : Method to perform union operation.
   parameters  :list1 -  The first list.
               :list2 -  The second list.
			   :outlist - The output List,which will contain non-duplicate elements present in list1 and list2 in sorted order
   All list extends set interface so duplicate elements will not be present.



-- difference method:Method to perform difference operation.
   parameters  :list1 -  The first list.
               :list2 -  The second list.
			   :outlist - The output List,which will contain non-duplicate elements present in list1 and not in list2 in sorted order.
   All list extends set interface so duplicate elements will not be present.


-- nextElement method : Method which will return the next element.
   input parameter : listIterator
   output parameter :next element in the iterator.
  
-- printElements method: method to print elemennts.
   parameter : list - list to print the elemennts.
